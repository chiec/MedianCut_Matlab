# MedianCut_Matlab
Median Cut colour quantization algorithm in Matlab.

Median Cut algorithm implementation in Matlab, done as an assignment for the Image Processing subject in college. I also uploaded the explanation in spanish I delivered to my professor.

Howto:
	1. mediancut('image_to_quantize.tiff', n_of_final_colours, 'final_quantized_image.tiff')
	- E.g.: mediancut('images/lena.tiff', 4, 'final.tiff')

	2. executing gui.m
